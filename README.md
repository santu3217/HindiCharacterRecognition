## Project Overview
This project is related to image classification in computer vision domain. In this project many libraries like Tensorflow, openCV, matplotlib etc and concepts of Deep Learning like "Transfer Learning" are used to train the model.

## Systen Requirements:
For this project I used Google colab to train my model
The Tensorflow version used for training is 2.8.0. If tensorflow is not installed in you system you can download it using this command

`pip install tensorflow`

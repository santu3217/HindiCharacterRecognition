## Project Overview
This project is related to image classification in computer vision domain. In this project many libraries like Tensorflow, openCV, matplotlib etc and concepts of Deep Learning like "Transfer Learning" are used to train the model.

## System Requirements:
For this project I used Google colab to train my model
The Tensorflow version used for training is 2.8.0. If tensorflow is not installed in you system you can download it using this command

`pip install tensorflow`

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was "Hindi Character Recognition". This [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/suvooo/hindi-character-recognition) is available in kaggle and you you can download it by pressing on the dataset link

## File Descriptions
This repository consists of 3 files:
#### 1. HindiCharacterRecognition_Preprocessing&Modeling.ipynb: 
This ipython notebook consists of the Pre-processing steps and the modeling part

#### 2. HindiCharacterRecognition_Covert2TFlite.ipynb:
This ipython notebook has the revelent steps and code for convering TF model to TF Lite model so that we can deploy and run this model in Mobile devices also

#### 3. HindiCharacterRecognition_Pedictions.ipynb:
This ipython notebook consists of steps and code to load and test the trained model
